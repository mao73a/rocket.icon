I use Rocket Chat app for work and sometimes I find it very disturbing when too many people wants to say sometihing. I think this application lacks possibility to delay some notifications and let user distinguish before less and more important channels.
This software is created to address some of these issues. Te Rocket Icon creates alternarive Windows tray icon. It enables user to have:
-different icons and sounds notifications for differnt channels
-customized delay periods for notifications. You can for example define notification frequency to be less frequent for some large boradcast channel.
-ability to mute notifications for specified amount of time, if you need to focus on some important work
